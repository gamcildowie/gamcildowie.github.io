		<p>It's a highly deceptive world, one that constantly asks you to comment but doesn't really care what you have to say. The illusion of participation can sometimes lead to participation. But more often than not, it only leads to more illusion, dressed in the guise of reality.</p>

<p>That is, we thought of <em>magic</em> as something that existed with or <strong>without us</strong>.</p>

<p>But that’s <strong>not</strong> true.</p>


<p>Things are not <em>magical</em> because they’ve been conjured for us by some <strong>outside force</strong>.</p>

<p>They are <em>magical</em> because <strong>we create them</strong>, and then deem them so.</p>

<p><span class="ryan">Ryan</span> and <span class="avery">Avery</span> will say the first moment they spoke, the first moment they danced,</p>

<p>was <em>magical.</em></p>

<p>But they were the ones - no one else, nothing else - who gave it the <em>magic.</em></p>

<p><strong>We</strong> know.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> were there.</p>

<p><span class="ryan">Ryan</span> <span class="open"><strong>opened</strong></span> himself to it.</p>

<p><span class="avery">Avery</span> <span class="open"><strong>opened</strong></span> himself to it.</p>

<p>And the act of <span class="open"><strong>opening</strong></span> was all they needed.</p>

<p>That is the <em>magic.</em></p>

	<p>There will come a time - perhaps even by the time you read this - that people will no longer be on Facebook. There will come a time when the stars of your favorite teen TV show will be sixty. There will come a time when you will have the same unalienable rights as your straightest friend. (Probably before any of the stars of your favorite teen TV show turn sixty.) There will come a time when the gay prom won't have to be separate. There will come a time when you look at someone younger than your and feel that he or she will know more than you ever did. There will come a time when you will worry about being forgotten. There will come a time when the gospel will be rewritten. </p>

	<p>If you play your cards right, the next generation will have so much more than you did.</p>
