<div class="block">
	The possibilities for <span>innovation</span> are not, by any means, exhausted.
		Technological development is always offering new opportunities
		for <span>innovative</span> <em>design</em>. But <span>innovative</span> <em>design</em> always develops in
		tandem with <span>innovative</span> technology,and can never be an end in itself.

	A product is bought to be <span>used</span>. It has to satisfy certain criteria,
	not only <span>functional</span> but also psychological and aesthetic.
	Good <em>design</em> emphasizes the <span>usefulness</span> of a product while
	disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.

	The <span>aesthetic</span> quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
		because products are used every day and have an effect on
		people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be <span>beautiful</span>.

	It <span>clarifies</span> the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product
		clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition.
		At best, it is <span>self-explanatory</span>.

	Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
		objects nor works of art. Their <em>design</em> should therefore be both <span>neutral</span>
		and <span>restrained</span>, to leave room for the user’s <span>self-expression</span>.

	It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it <span>really is</span>.
		It <span>does not</span> attempt to <span>manipulate</span> the consumer with promises that cannot be kept

	It avoids being fashionable and therefore <span>never</span> appears <span>antiquated</span>.
		Unlike fashionable <em>design</em>, it <span>lasts</span> many years – even in today’s throwaway society.

	Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. <span>Care</span> and <span>accuracy</span> in the <em>design</em> process
		show <span>respect</span> towards the consumer.

	<em>Design</em> makes an important contribution to the <span>preservation</span> of the <span>environment</span>.
		It <span>conserves</span> resources and <span>minimises</span> physical and visual <span>pollution</span>.

	<span>Less</span>, but better – because it <span>concentrates</span> on the essential aspects,
		and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to <span>purity</span>, back to <span>simplicity</span>.
