		<h1><strong><em>GOOD</em></strong> DESIGN IS...</h1>


		<ol>
			<h3><li>INNOVATIVE</li></h3>
			The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.<br>
				Technological development is always offering new opportunities <br>
				for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in <br>
				tandem with innovative technology,and can never be an end in itself.

			<h3><li>MAKES A PRODUCT USEFUL</li></h3>
			A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria,<br>
			not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic.<br>
			Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while <br>
			disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.

			<h3><li>AESTHETIC</li></h3>
			The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness <br>
				because products are used every day and have an effect on <br>
				people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

			<h3><li>MAKES A PRODUCT UNDERSTANDABLE</li></h3>
			It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product <br>
				clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. <br>
				At best, it is self-explanatory.

			<h3><li>UNOBTRUSIVE</li></h3>
			Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative <br>
				objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral <br>
				and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.

			<h3><li>HONEST</li></h3>
			It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. <br>
				It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept

			<h3><li>LONG LASTING</li></h3>
			It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.  <br>
				Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.</h6>

			<h3><li>THOROUGH DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL</li></h3>
			Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process <br>
				show respect towards the consumer.

			<h3><li>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</li></h3>
      Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. <br>
				It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution <br>
				throughout the lifecycle of the product.

	  	<h3><li>AS LITTLE DESIGN AS POSSIBLE</li></h3>
			Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, <br>
				and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
