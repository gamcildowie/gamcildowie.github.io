		<strong>Pink</strong> is female - but why? Are girls any more <strong>pink</strong> than boys?

		Are boys any more <span>blue</span> than girls?

 	<div class="maybe">
		<p>maybe it'll make people a little less scared of two boys kissing than they were before, and a little more welcoming to the idea that all people are, in fact, born equal.</p>

	<div class="intro">
		<p>It's a highly deceptive world, one that constantly asks you to comment but doesn't really care what you have to say. The illusion of participation can sometimes lead to participation. But more often than not, it only leads to more illusion, dressed in the guise of reality.</p>

<p>We <strong>always</strong> underestimated our own participation in <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>That is, we thought of <em>magic</em> as something that existed with or <strong>without us</strong>.</p>

<p>But that’s <strong>not</strong> true.</p>

<p>Things are not <em>magical</em> because they’ve been conjured for us by some <strong>outside force</strong>.</p>

<p>They are <em>magical</em> because <strong>we create them</strong>, and then deem them so.</p>

<p>Ryan and Avery will say the first moment they spoke, the first moment they danced,</p>

<p>was <em>magical</em>.</p>

<p>But they were the ones &nbsp;<em>no one else, nothing else</em> who gave it the magic.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> know.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> were there.</p>

<div class="ryan">
	<p>Ryan <strong>opened</strong> himself to it.</p>
</div>

<div class="avery">
	<p>Avery <strong>opened</strong> himself to it.</p>
</div>

<p>And the act of <strong>opening</strong> was <em>all they needed</em>.</p>

<p>That is the <em>magic</em>.</p>
